This was my first day using Git, and it was very different from the style of development I'm used to.
Using GitHub's courses made it easy to learn the basics and implement them to make a website. 
I had heard of GitHub prior to this, but I wasn't fully sure as to what it was. Now I have a much better understanding, 
and I am curious as to how Git can be used in coordination with other programming languages.
